        This is a sponsored long distance motorcycle ride to raise money
        organised by the Royal British Legions Riders Branch to raise funds for
        the Poppy Appeal. The event has been running since 2009 and has over 100
        riders taking part each year raising on average around £25,000 each
        year. You choose which pre-verified route you want to ride alone or with
        friends.
      </p>

      <p>
        All routes start and finish at Squires Café Bar near Leeds near the
        longest day so most of the route can be ridden in Daylight. By
        completing a 1000 miles inside 24 hrs and collecting receipts from the
        specified stops you will be verified as a lifelong member of the Iron
        Butt Association who organise the ride for the RBLR. Everyone who
        returns to the finish will receive a certificate of recognition.
      </p>

        Please read this document in full to ensure you understand the challenge
        and requirements for this event. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; IT HAS BEEN UPDATED
        THIS YEAR.
      </p>

      <h3>Step 1 - Choose a route &amp; Sign up online</h3>

      <p>
        There are three main routes to ride which all start and finish at
        Squires Cafe Bar, B1222, Newthorpe, near Sherburn in Elmet, West
        Yorkshire, LS25 5LX.
        <span class="w3w">///grazed.hardening.tangling</span>
      </p>

      <p>
        The main Northern and Southern routes are just over 1000 miles and can
        be ridden in either a clockwise or anti-clockwise direction. There's
        also a shorter 500 mile route which also can be ridden in either
        direction. This means you actually have six routes in total to choose
        from:
      </p>

      <table id="routelist">
        <tr>
          <td>Route A - North Clockwise</td>
          <td>Route B - North Anti-clockwise</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Route C - South Clockwise</td>
          <td>Route D - South Anti-clockwise</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Route E - 500 Clockwise</td>
          <td>Route F - 500 Anti-clockwise</td>
        </tr>
      </table>

      <p>
        Once you've decided which route you wish to ride complete the online
        entry form:<br />

          >https://britbuttrally.wufoo.com/forms/2025-rblr-1000-entry-form</a
        >
      </p>

      <p>
        Fill it in <strong>carefully</strong> as it is exactly how you will be
        registered for IBA membership and your certificate printed.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The entry fee is £25 per rider and £10 per pillion.</li>
        Tee-shirts and patches can be pre-ordered until 30th April 2025
        <li>You can make a donation on entry. The suggested minimum is £25</li>
        <li>There is an option for free camping onsite.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Step 2 - Download GPX files</h3>

      <p>
        GPX files can be downloaded from
        <a target="rblr1000" href="https://rblr1000.co.uk/satnav/"
          >https://rblr1000.co.uk/satnav/</a
        >
        to load into your mapping software or navigation device. You must visit
        every location listed and get a receipt to verified your distance at the
        finish. Be warned your bike odo reads high so do not rely on that to

      <h3>Step 3 - Plan your Ride</h3>

      <p>
        You are strongly advised to ride some longer days in all weather
        conditions, day and night. This will iron out any niggles with your kit,
        your bike and you that become major issues on long rides. Think about
        what kit to wear. Do any consumables need replacing on your bike (chain,
        tyres, bearings, oil)? Think about keeping hydrated and do not eat a big
        meal on the way around (it will make you tired digesting it)
      </p>

      <p>
        The key to long rides is to settle into your normal relaxed pace and
        practice minimising stops. You do not need to ride illegally just
        average 42mph over 24 hrs.
      </p>

      <p>
        You are advised to have a schedule of arrival times and distances of
        your route so you know if you are keeping to your plan.
      </p>

      <p>
        This
        <a
          target="rblr1000"
          href="https://forum.ironbutt.org/index.php?threads/rblr1000-7th-june-2025.6891/"
          >link</a
        >
        will take you to the IBA forum for the RBLR1000 where you can discuss
        preparation and seek advice from experienced IBA members.
      </p>
      <h3>Step 4 - Arrive at Squires ready to Start</h3>

      <p>
        Check -in will be from 3pm to 7pm on Friday 6th June. You will be
        invited to:-
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Pass over any donations</li>
        <li>Sign a disclaimer</li>
        <li>Collect your route card</li>
        <li>
          Check your emergency contact who must not be on the ride with you.
        </li>
        <li>Collect pre-ordered tee-shirt and patch from the IBAUK shop</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If it's impossible for you to check-in on Friday we can check you in on
        Saturday morning after the riders have left.
      </p>

      <h3>Step 5 - Ride your Plan</h3>

      <ul>
        <li>1000 miles riders leave from 5am on Saturday morning.</li>
        <li>500 mile riders leave from 6am on Saturday morning</li>
        <li>
          The staff will record your odo and start time.
        </li>
        <li>
          The ride does not require you to speed. If you (1000 milers) return
          within 17 hours of your leaving time we know you will have been
          speeding excessively and your ride will not be verified.
        </li>
        <li>
          Your ride time is not saved or published. The best time to finish in
          is between 20 hrs and 22 hrs. That ensures enough rest and normal
          riding.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        At every stop on your route card, obtain a printed receipt with location
        date and time. Check it before you leave. If there is a problem you can
        get a receipt from anywhere in the same town as the listed stop. The
        receipt can be for anything not necessarily fuel.<br />
        If you're unable to complete the ride for any reason please phone or
        text the emergency number on your receipt log. If you do not return and
        we cannot contact you, we will phone your emergency contact.
      </p>
      <h3>Step 6 - At the finish</h3>
      <p>
        At the finish the volunteers will wave you to a stop to record your odo
        and finish time. They will point you towards a
        parking place. After putting your receipts in the order you collected
        them, you should present them and your route card for verification to
        the IBAUK verifier who will (if you are successful) present your
        certificate. Every rider will get a certificate of recognition even if
        they fail verification or arrive back late.

      <h2>APPENDIX C - RIDING SAFELY</h2>

      <p>
        IMPORTANT - Remember this is for fun and riding is a hobby. There is no
        pressure to complete the ride should you become tired or otherwise feel
        unsafe.
      </p>
      <h3>Your First Iron Butt Ride</h3>
      <p>
        If this is Your First Iron Butt ride read
        <a href="https://ironbutt.co.uk/w3/firstukride.php"
          >https://ironbutt.co.uk/w3/firstukride.php</a
        >
        for good advice.
      </p>
      <h3>Group Riding</h3>
      <p>
        While group Saddlesore rides bring with them the safety of group travel,
        they can also increase your risk by encouraging you to press on when you
        might otherwise stop. So, be sure the riding styles of others in your
        group match your own. Practice riding in your group beforehand. Develop
        a system of communication, either verbal with intercom radios or by
        flashing your lights. In this way if somebody needs to stop for fuel or
        a rest they won't get left behind. This is especially important when
        it's only the person at the front who knows where they're going and how
        to get there! Also, it makes sense to have a plan should you decide to

      <h3>Fatique</h3>
      <p>
        Motorcycling comes with risk and riding long distances increases that
        risk. It's imperative you understand the ride you're undertaking and
        minimize the possibility of an accident by practising safe riding
        habits. No one, not even the most experienced Long Distance rider can
        safely fight off fatigue. If you're tired, the only option is to stop
        and rest. The Saddlesore rides enjoy a fantastic safety record but to
        continue this record requires you to do your part. If you are tired or
        ill, are having a bad day, or facing other hurdles that are impacting
        your riding skills, please stop and rest so that you may enjoy
        motorcycling another day!

        This is an article well worth reading about fatigue, caffeine and
        circadian rhythms.
